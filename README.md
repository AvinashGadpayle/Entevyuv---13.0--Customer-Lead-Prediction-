# Entevyuv---13.0--Customer-Lead-Prediction-

# Customer Lead Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict whether a lead will be successfully converted into a paying customer. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we optimize lead conversion rates and streamline lead management for improved efficiency.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found in [leads.csv](./data/leads_dataset.csv). This dataset contains information about leads, including lead origin, lead source, lead activities, and other related features.

## Code and Notebooks

The project is organized into Gooogle Colab:


## Getting Started

To run this project, you will need Python and the required libraries. Install dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Model Evaluation
We trained a Random Forest Classifier for this project. The model's performance was evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC. You can find these evaluation results in the project's code files and notebooks.

Conclusion and Suggestions
Based on the model's predictions, we can answer several key questions:

Which leads are most likely to convert into paying customers?
How can the platform prioritize and allocate resources to leads with the highest conversion potential?
What marketing and sales strategies can be tailored to specific lead segments?
How can the lead management process be streamlined and made more effective?
These insights can help optimize lead conversion rates and lead management efficiency.
